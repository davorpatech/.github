> davorpatech's template for organization resources.

This `.git` repository contains the community health files, metadatas and other resources across **[@davorpatech](https://github.com/davorpatech)** organization.


## Introduction

GitHub will use and display some of this default files for any public repository in [@davorpatech](https://github.com/davorpatech) organization that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- the root of the repository
- the `.github` folder
- the `docs` folder

For example, anyone who creates an issue or pull request in a public repository that does not have its own `CONTRIBUTING` file will see a link to the default `CONTRIBUTING` file.

The files are not included in `clones`, `packages`, or `downloads` of individual repositories because they are stored only in the `.github` repository.

You can learn more about this GitHub feature reading the article on [creating a default community health file for your organization](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization).


## Supported file types

- [`FUNDING`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository): A FUNDING file displays a sponsor button in a repository to increase the visibility of funding options for projects. 
- [`Issue and pull request templates`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates): Issue and pull request templates customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to include when they open issues and pull requests in repositories.
